    :name: HALT
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Exit Code (Integer)']
    :desc: >-
        Stops execution.

    :name: PUSH_CONST
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Unsigned index to constants table']
    :desc: >-
        Pushes a constant onto the stack.
        Constant is specified by a given index to the
        constant-table, containing all local constant.

-   :byte: 2
    :name: PUSH_LOCAL
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Local variable index (Unsigned)']
    :desc: >-
       Pushes a local variable (e.g. a function param)
       onto the stack. The local variable is identified by
       an index operand, to where it is in the current symbol
       table.

-   :byte: 3
    :name: PUSH_SUPER
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Name of super-scoped variable (String)']
    :desc: >-
       When a variable is out of the local scope, load it
       onto the stack by
       searching up the super-scope by its name, (much slower
       than `PUSH_LOCAL`).

-   :byte: 4
    :name: POP
    :operands: 0
    :desc: >-
       Pops the top element off of the stack.

-   :byte: 5
    :name: STORE_LOCAL
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Index to store local variable in table (Unsigned)']
    :desc: >-
       Pops the top value and stores it in the local symbol table
       at a given index.

-   :byte: 6
    :name: STORE_SUPER
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['Name of super-scoped variable (String)']
    :desc: >-
       When a variable is out of the local scope, pop it
       off of the stack to store it in the super-scope
       searching up the frames for its name, (much slower
       than `STORE_LOCAL`).


-   :byte: 6
    :name: DUP
    :operands: 0
    :desc: >-
        Duplicates what was on the top of the stack,
        by popping it off and then pushing two copies.

-   :byte: 7
    :name: DUP_N
    :operands: 1
    :operand_desc: ['The number of duplicates']
    :desc: >-
        Duplicates the top value on the stack N times.

-   :byte: 8
    :name: SWAP
    :operands: 0
    :desc: >-
        Swaps the position of the top two stack elements.
